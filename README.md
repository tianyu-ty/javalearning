Description: 
Iâ€™m learning about interfaces now, so I want to apply them in this program. In this program, I created a Participant class and defined the required properties, as well as the corresponding setters and getters in this class. Then I created a ParticipantOperator interface and defined two methods, one for classifying participants by type of sport and the other for sorting participants by number of awards. Afterwards, I created the ParticipantManager class and defined the list of participant arrays and interfaces. I created a ParticipantOperatorImpl1 class to inherit the ParticipantOperator interface and override its two methods. Finally, create a test class Main test program.

Development environment:
java version "1.8.0_381"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_381-b09)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.381-b09, mixed mode)
